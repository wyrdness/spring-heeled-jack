      "full": "Spring-Heeled Jack stands as one of Victorian England's most enduring and enigmatic urban legends—a figure that terrorized London and surrounding regions for nearly seven decades. Described as a demonic entity capable of leaping over buildings, breathing blue flames, and attacking primarily young women, Spring-Heeled Jack represents a unique intersection of folklore, social anxiety, mass hysteria, and genuine criminal activity that has never been definitively explained. The legend emerged during a period of rapid industrialization, urban expansion, and social upheaval in England. What began as scattered reports of a mysterious leaping figure evolved into a full-blown moral panic that gripped Victorian society, spawned countless penny dreadful stories, and left an indelible mark on British folklore. The entity's name itself became synonymous with terror, representing fears about urban danger, class conflict, women's vulnerability, and the unknown threats lurking in London's dark streets."
